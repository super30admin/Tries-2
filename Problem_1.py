# Word Squares

# Time Complexity : O(N.26 exponential L)
# Space Complexity : O(Nâ‹…L) where N is the number of words and L is the length of a single word.

"""
For a valid word square to happen length of strings should be same. 
Backtracking is involved so after placing the first word information about
words starting with further characters/alphabets is checked and a trie data 
structure is maintained with augmneted strings.
